# Summary of PyCitySchools Findings
In reviewing the data, there are a few trends that are worth calling out.

First, the appears to be a trend of the surveyed schools performing better with test scores the less they spend per student. Schools spending less than $585 per 
student see 93.5% of students passing math, 96.6% passing reading, and 90.4% passing overall (both math and reading). Even as the schools spend between $585 and $630
per student, the passing rates drope to 87.1% for math, 92.7% for reading, and 81.4% overall. When schools are spending between $645 and $680 per student, the 
pass rates fall down to 66.2% for math, 81.1 % for reading, and 53.5% overall. 

Second, passing rates have an equally drastic difference depending on whether a school is a charter school or district school. For charter schools, the 
percent of students passing math is 93.6%, passing reading is 96.6% and passing overall is 90.4%. District schools fare much worse, with only 66.5% of students 
passing math, 80.8% of students passing reading and 53.7% of students passing overall.

School size has a similar impact, though there, the clearest differences are between schoolswith over 2000 students or fewer than 2000 students.

However, the clearest trend is that between those three ways to compare schools (by per student spending, by school size or by whether a school is run by 
charter or the district), math scores drop the most. Reading scores tend to drop by about 15% in each case (per student spending drops by 15.5%, school size drops 
by 13.4% and school type drops by 15.7%) where math scores drop by over 30% in all cases.
